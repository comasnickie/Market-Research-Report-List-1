<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The KrF Resist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive KrF Resist</li><li>Negative KrF Resist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The KrF resist market is segmented into two primary types: positive and negative KrF resists. Positive KrF resist materials become soluble when exposed to ultraviolet light, allowing for the creation of fine patterns on substrates. They are primarily used in advanced semiconductor manufacturing. Conversely, negative KrF resists become less soluble when exposed to UV light, resulting in the remaining material defining the pattern. Both types serve critical roles in lithography processes, catering to different application requirements in the semiconductor industry.</p></p>
