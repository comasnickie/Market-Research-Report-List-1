<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radar Level Gauge Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-contact Radar Level Gauge</li><li>Guided Wave Radar Level Gauge</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The radar level gauge market consists of two primary types: non-contact radar level gauges and guided wave radar level gauges. Non-contact radar level gauges operate by emitting microwave signals that reflect off the surface of a liquid or solid, measuring the distance based on the time it takes for the signal to return. In contrast, guided wave radar level gauges use a probe or waveguide that transmits radar signals along its length, providing precise measurements of material levels, especially in challenging conditions.</p></p>
