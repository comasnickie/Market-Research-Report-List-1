<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Ventilation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-invasive Ventilation</li><li>Invasive Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mechanical ventilation market comprises two primary types: non-invasive ventilation and invasive ventilation. Non-invasive ventilation utilizes masks or nasal interfaces to assist patients with respiratory issues while maintaining natural breathing, making it suitable for conditions like COPD and sleep apnea. In contrast, invasive ventilation involves intubation or tracheostomy, delivering airflow directly to the lungs, typically used in severe cases such as critical illness or during surgery. Both types cater to varying patient needs across healthcare settings.</p></p>
