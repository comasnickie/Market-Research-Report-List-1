<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cartilage Repair & Regeneration Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cell-Based</li><li>Non-Cell-Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cartilage repair and regeneration market is primarily divided into two types: cell-based and non-cell-based approaches. Cell-based therapies involve the use of living cells, such as chondrocytes or stem cells, to stimulate cartilage regeneration and healing. These techniques often provide personalized treatment tailored to individual patients. In contrast, non-cell-based methods rely on biomaterials, growth factors, or scaffolding techniques to support cartilage repair without live cells. Both approaches aim to restore joint function and alleviate pain in patients with cartilage damage.</p></p>
